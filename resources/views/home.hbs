        <p>SIL International is a faith-based nonprofit organization committed to serving language
          communities worldwide as they build capacity for sustainable language development. SIL does this
          primarily through research, translation, training and materials development. SIL works alongside
          ethnolinguistic communities and their partners as they discover how language development
          addresses the challenging areas of their daily livesâ€”social, cultural, political, economic and
          spiritual. SIL Language Technology supports these activities by developing software, fonts and
          keyboards</p>
