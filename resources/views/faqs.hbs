                When you donate to the SIL International, we receive personal information from you. We use this data to
                acknowledge your
                donation, provide you with donation receipts, and correspond with you through newsletters or email. You
                can read more

              <p>We work hard to protect your information. We believe in, and practice, multi-layered security controls
                and practices,
                including both technical and organizational methods. We have agreements with third parties and have

                under our

                contractually
                obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by SIL International. The vendors we use to send
                emails or other
                marketing materials to you aren’t permitted to use your information for their own direct marketing
                purposes. They also
                aren’t allowed to share your data with anyone else for direct marketing purposes. In addition, we will
                keep your
                personal data only for as long as we need it to provide you services, manage our business or as required
                by law or

                SIL's work. In
